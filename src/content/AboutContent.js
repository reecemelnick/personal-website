    title: "About Me",
    text: `Hi, I’m a computing student at BCIT with a passion for technology and a drive for continuous growth. 
  Before diving into the world of software development, I ran my own auto detailing business for two years, 
  where I honed my entrepreneurial and problem-solving skills. 
  
  Running my own business taught me the importance of adaptability, time management, and delivering excellent 
  customer service—qualities I now apply to my journey in software development. I’m constantly exploring new 
  technologies and refining my technical skills in programming languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Java, and C. 
  I’m driven to craft innovative and practical solutions that are both technically robust and user-focused.
